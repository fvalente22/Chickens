So for the less than symbol you use lt. Also use this for symbols that cant be typed out, like a heart or spade  -->

        <!-- div is essentially just a way to line something up. So without div being used below, "i am a link to google" would show next to the picture in the same block. Dev helps provide a border. Need more clarification on this because still having trouble understanding this. Theres other versions of div as well, such as header, footer, summary, main, etc (called Semantic Elements/Markups). So instead of div you'd use other, more specific elements They all work the same, you would just use them based off where in the site their being utilized so its cleaner, more organized. Maybe ask Courtney -->

        <p>The <b>chicken</b> is a type of domesticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken">fowl</a></p>



        <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
            Asia,<sup><a href="somesource.com">[5]</a></sup> but
            the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.
            From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century
            BCE.[6]
            Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BCE, with the "bird that gives birth every day"
            having
            come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]
